Vastsky how-to for administrators

- Power-off the whole system

	Run "service vas_sm shudown" on the storage manager and then
	shutdown each servers.

- Power-on the whole system

	Simply power-on each servers.  You can safely start servers
	in any order.

- Watch events like hardware failures

	You can use list-type commands like hsvr_list, ssvr_list and
	pdsk_list to check the status of resources.

- Add a new head or storage server to the system

	Simply set up the server as documented in vas_install.txt,
	connect it to the network, and turn it on.  On startup,
	the server will automatically register itself to the storage manager.

- Remove a head or storage server from the system

	CAVEAT: When you want to remove a storage server, be careful about
	data redundancy to avoid data-loss.

	Disconnect the server from the network and wait until its status
	become OFFLINE.  You can check the server status with hsvr_list or
	ssvr_list command.  And then use hsvr_delete or ssvr_delete command
	to clean up the corresponding server record in the database.

- Replace a broken hardware

	Remove the whole server from the system.
	After fixing the broken hardware, you can re-install it as a new
	server.
