Vastsky Command Reference Manual
================================

This documentation describes vastsky user commands.
See vas_examples.txt for some usage examples.

Logical volume operations
- lvol_create create a logical volume
- lvol_delete delete a logical volume
- lvol_attach attach a logical volume
- lvol_detach detach a logical volume
- lvol_list   list logical volumes
- lvol_show   show details of a logical volume
- snap_create create a snapshot

Resource info retrieval
- hsvr_list   list head servers
- ssvr_list   list storage servers
- pdsk_list   list physical disks

Resource deletion
- hsvr_delete  delete a head server
- ssvr_delete  delete a storage server
- pdsk_delete  delete a physical disk

Note that resources are automatically registered by head servers and
storage servers on their startup.  Thus there are no "pdsk_create" style
user commands.


lvol_create
-----------

<synopsis>
    lvol_create [options] lvolname capacity

<description>
    Create a logical volume.

    <lvolname> is the logical volume name of the logical volume.
    Logical volume names should be a system-wide unique string up to 64
    characters.  Only alphanumeric characters and ".-_" can be used.
    Logical volume names which can be interpreted as a logical volume id
    can't be used.  (eg. "lvol-12345678")

    <capacity> specifies the capacity of the logical volume in GB.
    It will be automatically rounded up to a multiple of 10GB.

    On a successful exit, lvol_create outputs the logical volume id
    of the created logical volume.

<options>
    -h | --help  Show usage
    --redundancy N  Specifies the redundancy of the logical volume.
		    The default is 3.


lvol_delete
-----------

<synopsis>
    lvol_delete [options] lvol

<description>
    Delete the logical volume specified by <lvol>.
    <lvol> should be either a logical volume id or a logical volume name.
    A non-snapshot logical volume attached to a head server can't be deleted.

<options>
    -h | --help  show usage


lvol_attach
-----------

<synopsis>
    lvol_attach [options] lvol hsvrid

<description>
    Attach the logical volume specified by <lvol> to the head server specified
    by <hsvrid>.
    <lvol> should be either a logical volume id or a logical volume name.
    A logical volume attached to the other head server can't be attached.

<options>
    -h | --help  show usage


lvol_detach
-----------

<synopsis>
    lvol_detach [options] lvol

<description>
    Detach the logical volume specified by <lvol>.
    <lvol> should be either a logical volume id or a logical volume name.
    A logical volume currently being used on the head server (eg. being
    mounted) can't be detached.
    If the logical volume is not currently attached, lvol_detach will
    succeed.

<options>
    -h | --help  show usage


lvol_list
---------

<synopsis>
    lvol_list [options] [lvol]

<description>
    List logical volumes.
    If <lvol> is specified, only list the logical volume specified.
    Otherwise, show all logical volumes in the system.
    <lvol> should be either a logical volume id or a logical volume name.
