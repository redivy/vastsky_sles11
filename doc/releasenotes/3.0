Vastsky 3.0 release note

Vastsky is a linux-based cluster storage system, which provides logical
volumes (linux block devices) to users by aggregating disks over a network.

Vastsky includes Xen Cloud Platform SR driver so that it can be used
as a storage backend for XCP.  (tested with XCP 0.5 RC1)

Moreover, Vastsky provides Eucalyptus support with which Vastsky's
volume can be used as EBS volume.  (tested with Eucalyptus 2.0 OSS version)


Changes from Vastsky 2.1 includes:
	- Logical volume snapshot support
	- Eucalyptus EBS support
	- TGT iscsi target support
	- Major internal rework to improve robustness

CAUTION: The storage manager database used by Vastsky 3.0 is incompatible
with the one created by Vastsky 2.1.  Unfortunately there's no easy way to
convert it.  I.e. when upgrading from Vastsky 2.1, your will lose your
logical volume configurations.
