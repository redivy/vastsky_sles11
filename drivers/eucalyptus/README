  This directory contains Eucalyptus(http://eucalyptus.com/) integration code
  for vastsky. This allows you to use vastsky storage volume as 
  Eucalyptus' EBS volume. 

  Unfortunately, Eucalyptus (at least OSS version) doesn't 
  provide runtime pluggability for external storage. So it is required to
  recompile with some of the code in this directory. Enjoy!

Source files:

  o SC side: 
    - VASManager.java:
      This implements LogicalStorageManager interface
      for vastsky. 

    - vas_sc_driver.py:
      These get called from createVolume(), deleteVolume(), createSnapshot(), 
      deleteSnapshot in VASManager class.
      This should be linked from/copied to vas_<methodName> executable file.
          
  o NC side:
    - vas_nc.against-v2.0.patch:
       This allows Node Controller to attach/detach vastsky volumes to/from
       its hosting running instances. Currently this is a bit nasty hack.
       Need to push this driver forward to the community.

    - vas_nc_driver.py
      This is a callee from NC to handle attach/detach requests.

  o common library:
    - vas_euca_driver.py 
       


Build and install:

  - Edit build_n_install.sh to set SRC_TOPDIR to the eucalyptus
    source dir. Only tested with a directory as SRC_TOPDIR that has previously 
    built binaries without any modification to the source files.

  - Execute build_n_install.sh

  - deploy the resulting objects accordingly to the nodes that you have in your system.


Runtime requirements:

  - cli tools of vastsky need to be installed both on CLC and NC. 

  - Set the following config parameter in eucalyptus.conf

    CLOUD_OPTS="-Debs.storage.manager=VASManager"


Known issues and limitations:

  - Currently we only have xen version for NC code, but supporting KVM should 
    be piece of cake or just a matter of time. 

  - In some cases, Eucalyptus doesn't catch error although we throw an exception.
    Particularly, watch out when creating/deleting/(creating volume from) snapshots.

  - Creating volume from a snapshot can only be possible when the original of the 
    snapshot is either not attached to anywhere or attached to the storage controller.

TODO:

  - better error handling
